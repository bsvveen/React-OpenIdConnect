### Simple React Wrapper around [OIDC-Client](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js).

## Install

##### NPM

`npm install --save react-openidconnect`

## Usage

Import the component and add ```<Authenticate>``` to you react app. All its children will be rendered when the user is authenticated. Otherwise a text is show asking the user to login, this text is provided as a prop. 

The JWT is provided trough the callback **'userLoaded'** and is called at them moment the user is retrieved from the identityserver. **'userUnLoaded'** is called when the user is removed from session. Its up to you to decided what to do with the JWT.

Depending on the IdentityServer used, the JWT has an **acces_token** and an **id_token** which can be used to add to your Fecth request headers as bearer token. This will grant you access to the resource server.

## Example

_Assuming a Create-React app._

1 - Change your app.js file to

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Authenticate from 'react-openidconnect';
import OidcSettings from './oidcsettings';
 
class App extends Component {
 
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.userLoaded = this.userLoaded.bind(this); 
    this.userUnLoaded = this.userUnLoaded.bind(this);
 
    this.state = { user: undefined };
  }  
 
  userLoaded(user) {
    if (user)
      this.setState({ "user": user });
  } 
  
  userUnLoaded() {
    this.setState({ "user": undefined });
  } 
 
 LoadingMenu() {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
 }
 
  NotAuthenticated() {
    return <div>You are not authenticated, please click here to authenticate.</div>;
  }

  // @NOTE This function is optional. If you not pass it will looks for "#id_token" in the URL
  checkAuthentication() {
    return window.location.href.includes("my_token_hash"); 
  }
 
  render() {
      return (
        <Authenticate         
          OidcSettings={OidcSettings} 
          checkAuthentication={checkAuthentication}
          userLoaded={this.userLoaded} 
          userunLoaded={this.userUnLoaded} 
          renderLoading={this.LoadingMenu}
          renderNotAuthenticated={this.NotAuthenticated}
        >
            <div>If you see this you are authenticated.</div>
        </Authenticate>
      )
  }
}

export default App;
```

2 - Create a oidcsettings.js file in the same map as you app.js and provide the Oidc settings. You should retrieve these settings from you identity provider. Getting these settings right is normally the most frustrating part.

### OidcSettings provides the following properties.

- **authority** (string): The URL of the OIDC/OAuth2 provider.
- **client_id**	(string): Your client application’s identifier as registered with the OIDC/OAuth2 provider.
- **redirect_uri** (string): The redirect URI of your client application to receive a response from the OIDC/OAuth2 provider.
- **scope**	(string): The scope being requested from the OIDC/OAuth2 provider (default: ‘openid’).
- **response_type**: 'id_token token'.
- **post_logout_redirect_uri**: (string): The redirect URI of your client after logout.  

#### Example:

```js
var OidcSettings = {    
    authority: 'https://****/identity',
    client_id: 'myclientid',
    redirect_uri: 'https://localhost:9090/',    
    response_type: 'id_token token',
    scope: 'openid profile roles',
    post_logout_redirect_uri: 'https://localhost:9090/'      
};
```

3 - You need to start your React app using the same url as in redirect_uri. The way to do this is to change the start script inside your package.json to.

```js
windows
"start": "set PORT=9090&&set HTTPS=true&&react-scripts start" 

other
"start": "set PORT=9090 set HTTPS=true react-scripts start" (other)
```

**NOTE**: when authenticating against an identity provider, a redirect is used to provide the required token via the querystring. The ```<Authenticate>``` needs to pick-up this token so be sure the component is rendered when the redirect-url is called.
